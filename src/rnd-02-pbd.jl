"""A type of rectricted randomization, representing _**P**_ermuted _**B**_lock _**D**_esign (_**PBD**_).

`PBD(λ)` command initializes a _permuted block_ randomization procedure with a _block size_

`PBD(w, λ)` command initializes a _permuted block_ randomization procedure with a parameter `λ`, 
targeting allocation specified by `w`; block size equals to `λ*sum(w)`.

An output of both commands is an instance of `PBD`.
