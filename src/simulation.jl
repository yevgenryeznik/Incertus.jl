"""A type, representing an output of a simulated randomization procedure.

A command `SimulatedRandomization(trt, prb)` initializes an instance of `SimulatedRandomization`:

- `trt` is a matrix of size ``n\\times S``, representing treatment assignments;
- `prb` is an array of size ``n\\times K\\times S``, representing allocation probabilities,

where 

- ``n`` is the number of subjects simulated;
- ``K`` is the number of treatments simulated (equal to the length of the target allocation vector);
- ``S`` is the number of simulations performed.
